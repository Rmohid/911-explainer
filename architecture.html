            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The 911 emergency telephone system is a critical infrastructure connecting citizens to emergency services. Its architecture has significantly evolved from its initial analog-based design to the modern, IP-based Next Generation 911 (NG911) system, enabling faster, more accurate responses and supporting new forms of communication.</p>

            <h2>Traditional (Legacy) 911 Architecture</h2>
            <p>The legacy 911 system primarily relies on the traditional telephone network (PSTN) and focuses on voice calls from landlines and early mobile phones.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP):</strong> Emergency call centers that receive 911 calls and dispatch responders based on jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><strong>Selective Router:</strong> Telecom-operated switch routing calls to the correct PSAP using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) for landlines or pseudo-ANI (pANI) for wireless, based on geographic tables.</li>
                <li><strong>ALI Database (Automatic Location Identification):</strong> Stores fixed location data (address) linked to ANIs in the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG). For wireless calls, it holds temporary location info provided by the carrier.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD):</strong> System used within the PSAP for logging incidents, managing resources, and coordinating responder dispatch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next Generation 911 (NG911) Architecture</h2>
            <p>NG911 leverages modern IP-based networks (Internet Protocol) to overcome the limitations of the legacy system. It supports various data types beyond voice, improves location accuracy, and enhances interoperability. One key feature is advanced call conferencing.</p>

            <h3>Key Components (NG911)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ESInet (Emergency Services IP Network):</strong> A secure, managed IP network replacing legacy 911 trunks. It transports voice, data, text, and video.</li>
                <li><strong>NGCS (Next Generation Core Services):</strong> Functional elements within the ESInet, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ECRF (Emergency Call Routing Function):</strong> Uses geospatial data (GIS) to determine the appropriate PSAP based on the caller's precise location.</li>
                        <li><strong>LVF (Location Validation Function):</strong> Validates civic addresses against the GIS database in real-time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>GIS Database:</strong> Geospatial Information System data replaces the traditional MSAG/ALI. It provides accurate, map-based location information, potentially including vertical location (e.g., floor level).</li>
                <li><strong>BCF (Border Control Function):</strong> Secure gateway managing traffic entering and leaving the ESInet.</li>
                <li><strong>PSAP (NG911 Enabled):</strong> PSAPs upgraded with IP-based equipment and software to receive calls and data (including multimedia) from the ESInet.</li>
